            <h2>Retrospectives</h2>
            <p>This week was a quick transition from our break, but at the same time, it felt familiar from last term. I was able to quickly get back into the routine and get started on the assignment. I’ve found myself enjoying the planning phase of the research, partially because I'm targeting an issue I found interesting and that is relevant to me. As much as I enjoy planning, I was not able to complete this week's sprint due to getting a short burnout over the weekend. Moreover, I found myself losing motivation when it came to the secondary research, and progress became very slow. I need to work on being more present with my work and staying consistence with my productivity. </p>
