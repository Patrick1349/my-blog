            <h2>Retrospectives</h2>
            <p>I was able to get complete my lo-fi prototype and my branding strategy. I'm enjoy the process and the idea I came up with. What didn't go so well is reallising that my previous idea has already been done and I have to rethink my idea which ended up being the one that I like the most. I've learn not to be too attached to an idea and keep trying new things.</p>
