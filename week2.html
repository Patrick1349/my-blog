                <p>Yesterday I gotten a start on the blog's Retrospective. Today's plan is to complete last week retrospective and conclude my topic research with a problem statement. I need to stay focus and not get distracted. The minimum goal for today is to get a problem statement.</p>

                <h2>Tue 6/05/2025</h2>
                <p>Yesterday, I have completed my secondary research and problem statement for the topic of choice. Today I will be getting a start on the UX research; I was thinking about doing a research on UX's red flag. I'm also thinking about starting the WIP to get it going for tomorrow. Today's obstacle is to make sure I manage my time well because I have lots to do today.</p>

                <h2>Wed 7/05/2025</h2>
                <p>Yesterday I got a start on my WIP01's slides and planned my KanBan and sprint. Today I have to replan the KanBan and sprint as I thought I needed to do another research, which I don't. I'm also gonna get a start on the define phase. Do some user journey and emphathy map. No blocker for the day.</p>

                <h2>Thu 8/05/2025</h2>
                <p>I completed my empathy map and my user journey. I also did some ideation to get some ideas going. Today's plan is to do more user journey, ideation and my WIP01 presentation. No blocker for the day.</p>

            <h2>Retrospectives</h2>
            <p>Week 2 has been less productive, more defining my research. I was relief being able to meet my sprint's expectations. What contributed to this was putting myself in a productive environment to keep myself accountable. What I didn't expect was how formally informal the presentation was. I didn't put too much effort into my presentation slides thinking it would have been fine, which turn out to be quite a mess. I need to make sure I prepare well for the next WIP. I also need to remain consistent with my routine. I've found out I have been losing energy throughout the week; I need to make sure I sleep well and consume enough food to last me the whole day. Next week's sprint, I'm going to be working on my lo-fi prototype and come up with a proof of concept.</p>
