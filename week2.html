                <p>Yesterday, I have completed my secondary research and problem statement for the topic of choice. Today I will be getting a start on the UX research; I was thinking about doing a research on UX's red flag. I'm also thinking about starting the WIP to get it going for tomorrow. Today's obstacle is to make sure I manage my time well because I have lots to do today.</p>
